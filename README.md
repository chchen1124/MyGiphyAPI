# MyGiphyAPI

Summary: MyGiphy API is an AJAX application that allows the user to click on buttons to display gifs of whatever topics are on the buttons. The user can enter in new topics in a textbox and the buttons of those new topics will appear. The rating for each gif appears right above the gifs themselves. You can click on the gifs to animate them or make them become still.
